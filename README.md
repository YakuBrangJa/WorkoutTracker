## This is my first object oriented JavaScript project.

**What the app does:**

-  It allows you to record your workout activities and keep track of them on real time map.
-  To add an activity, click on the map to mark your location. Then fill the form and hit enter.


Note: This project is a part of [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://twitter.com/jonasschmedtman)'s JS course which I took.

**What the course covers about the project:**

- Leaflet library
- Workout activity adding feature
- Rendering the activity on both panel list and on map.
- LocalStorage data storing
- Fetching LocalStorage data and rendering on load

**My part in the project:**

- Activity editing
- Activity deleting
