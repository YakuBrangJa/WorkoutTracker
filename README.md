## This is my first JS project built with Object Oriented approach.

**What the app does:**

- It allows you to record your workout activities and keep track of them on real time map.
- To add an activity click on the map to mark your location then fill the form and hit enter.

**Parts of the project which the course covers:**

- Workout activity adding feature
- Rendering the activity on both panel list and on map.
- LocalStorage data storing
- Fetching LocalStorage data and rendering on load
- Leaflet library

**My parts in the project:**

- Activity editing
- Activity deleting
- LocalStorage data updating on each delete/edit
