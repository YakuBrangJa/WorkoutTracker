**What the app does:**

- It allows you to record your workout activities and keep track of them on real time map.
- To add an activity click on the map to mark your location then fill the form and hit enter.

Note: This project is a part of [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://twitter.com/jonasschmedtman)'s JS course which I took.

**Parts of the project which the course covers:**

- Activity adding feature
- Rendering the activities on the panel list and on the map.
- LocalStorage data storing
- Fetching LocalStorage data and rendering on loading
- Leaflet library

**My parts in the project:**

- Activity editor
- Delete feature
- Update LocalStorage data on each delete/edit
